# plant-pollinator-inference 

Code for "Reconstruction of plant--pollinator networks from observational data", implemented in [Stan](http://mc-stan.org), with an emphasis on the `pystan` interface.


Pull requests with code for other Stan interfaces are more than welcomed!


## Dependencies

The only necessary dependency is `stan`. 
Our model will of course work with any [stan interface](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/index.html), but we provide a number of utilities geared toward its use with [`pystan`](https://pypi.org/project/pystan/), the main python interface.

To install pystan, simply run:

    pip install pystan


## Quickstart

[Our model](model.stan) takes an observation matrix as input (matrix of non-negative integers), and outputs parameters samples as well as edge probabilities conditioned on these parameters.

Hence, for those familiar with `pystan`, running the model is as simple as

```python
import pystan
import numpy as np
# Compile the model
model = pystan.StanModel(`model.stan`, model_name="plant_pol")
# Sample
M = np.loadtxt('example_matrix.txt')
samples = model.sampling(data={'M': M, 'n_p': M.shape[0], 'n_a': M.shape[1]})
# Calculate estimates
print("Average posterior connectance:", np.mean(samples['rho'], axis=0))
```


where `n_p` and `n_a` are the dimension of the observation matrix `M`.

For those unfamiliar with Stan, we have written [a short tutorial](python_example.ipynb), as well as two python modules that abstract away most of the complexity associated with manipulating samples.
